       <b> On January 5, 2021  new confirmed cases of COVID-19 recorded 1,204 in Nigeria, taking the total number of infections to 91,351.</b> 
 <br />
 The Nigeria Centre For Disease Control (NCDC) made this known via its verified website.
 
 The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that Nigeria recorded 1,145 cases on Dec. 18, 2020.
 
 The centre also announced seven deaths in the last 24 hours, bringing the country’s death toll to 1,318.
 
 It stated that three of the deaths occurred in Lagos, two in Sokoto, while Kebbi and Abia recorded one fatality each.
 <br />
 
 The NCDC said that the number of recovered COVID-19 patients stood at 75,699, including 655 patients that were discharged on Monday after testing negative from the virus.
 
 It said that Lagos, the epicentre of COVID-19, recorded the highest number of cases with 654, while FCT recorded 200.
 
 Other states are Plateau-60, Kaduna-54, Kano-40, Rivers-30, Edo-28, Nasarawa-25, Kebbi-19, Bauchi-18, Oyo-13, Akwa Ibom-12, Bayelsa-11, Ogun-11, Delta-nine, Abia-eight, Benue-five, Imo-three, Borno-two, Sokoto-one and Osun-one.
 <br />
 
 The agency said that a multi-sectoral national Emergency Operations Centre (EOC) has been activated at Level III, to coordinate the national response activities.
 
 The agency noted that till date, 91,351 cases had been confirmed, 75,699 cases discharged and 1,318 deaths recorded in 36 states and the FCT.
 <br />
 
 Meanwhile, the agency called on those who may have been exposed to the virus to quarantine and isolate themselves if they feel ill.
 
 <qoute> “Remember COVID-19 can spread from people that look and feel well. Don’t let your guard down around friends or relatives just because they look healthy – they may not know they are infected but can unintentionally spread COVID-19,” it advised.
 </qoute>
 <br />
 <br />
 
 NAN reports the centre has so far tested 958,911 persons since the first confirmed case relating to the COVID-19 pandemic was announced in Feb. 27 2020.
 
 NAN also reports that the Federal Government on Dec. 22, 2020 imposed new restrictions amid the rising cases of COVID-19 in various parts of the country.
 <br />
 
 The Chairman of the Presidential Task Force (PTF) on COVID-19, Boss Mustapha, explained that the directives were advisories issued to state authorities for implementation in the next five weeks.
 
 The new restrictions include civil servants from Grade Level 12 and below to stay at home for the next five weeks; the closure of all bars, nightclubs, pubs and event centres, as well as recreational venues in all states and the FCT.
 
 All restaurants were also directed to close, except those providing services to hotel residents, takeaways, home deliveries and drive-ins

       <b>The U.S. has hit another devastating milestone: COVID-19 has killed more than 350,000 people in the country, according to a Johns Hopkins University tracker.</b>
       <br />
         The grim number comes as a new variant of the coronavirus is spreading across dozens of countries.
 
 The coronavirus variant was first spotted last month in the U.K. and has now spread to dozens of countries, likely passed on by infected people who traveled around the world and unknowingly brought the microscopic invaders with them.
 
 The variant is now in dozens of countries, including the United States, where it has infected people in Colorado, California and Florida.
 <br />
 <br />
 Health care workers are bracing for a particularly deadly January, after the U.S saw record high numbers of infections in December. President-elect Joe Biden cautioned this week that "the next few weeks and months are going to be very tough, a very tough period for our nation — maybe the toughest during this entire pandemic."<br />
 <br />
 Researchers say the new variant — dubbed B.1.1.7 — probably originated in the South East region of England in September, before being detected there in November. According to a new report from Imperial College London, Britain's November lockdown did little to curb its spread, which was most prevalent in young people under 20 years old. The World Health Organization says the new variant is responsible for more than half of new infections in the U.K.

 The estimated $15.7 billion lost annually to IFF is more than enough to cater for the $13.6 billion budgetary deficit.

 Budget cuts caused by COVID-19-motivated economic downturns are posing a threat to Nigeria’s ability to curb Illicit Financial Flows (IFF) which a report says cost the country about $15.7 billion annually.
 <br />
 The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), which is the government’s flagship anti-corruption agency with the most versatile mandates to fight IFF and other enabling crimes, enters 2021 with a cut from the N32.7 billion ($86.3million) allocated to it in 2020.
 
 The 2021 national budget newly signed into law by President Muhammadu Buhari shows that N29.6 billion ($78.5million) is allocated to the agency in 2021, translating into a cut of as much as N3.1billion ($7.8million) from its 2020 allocation.
 <br />
 <br />
 Meanwhile, a recent case of how Freiherr Fedrick Von Hahn, a German, was duped of €880,000 with part of the proceeds illicitly making its way to Nigeria and further disbursed to foreign collaborators between April and May 2020, highlights the need for the country to step up its fight against IFF during the pandemic.
 <br />
 
 Mr Von Hahn, who had struck a deal with a Dutch pharmaceutical company, ILBA Holding BV, for the supply of 11 million COVID facemasks meant for the state of North Rhine-Wesphalia in Germany, was swindled through a cloned e-mail in a transborder money laundering scheme perpetrated in Germany, the Netherlands and Nigeria.
 <br />
 While two Dutch collaborators have since been convicted in their country, the ongoing prosecution of Nigerian suspects by the Federal Ministry of Justice may be negatively impacted by the cut of about N2.99 billion ($7.9million) from the N32 billion ($84.5million) allocated to it in the 2020 budget.
 <br />
 <br />
 Speaking on the possible impact of budget costs on the anti-graft war, Oluwaleke Atolagbe, who is a member of a team of EFCC’s external prosecutors, said, “When money laundering activities are across borders, we know for instance that investigating bodies would have to work with sister agencies in other jurisdictions and even the governments of such countries”.
 
 “The officers of the investigating agencies would require training and retraining; they would need to travel to and from different countries and all these would require funds,” the lawyer added.
